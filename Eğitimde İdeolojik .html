The Impact of Ideological Language in Education on Child Psychology

Every discourse used within the education system shapes not only politics, but also the inner world of a child.

The recent statements made by the Minister of National Education should be read not merely as an adult political polemic, but as an attempt to program the subconscious of an entire generation.

👶 Psychological Reality

A child’s inner world is constructed at the intersection of belief, freedom, and belonging.
When an education policy begins to suppress this balance:

Some children turn into obedient individuals,

Others grow up struggling with identity conflict.

In both cases, healthy psychological development is disrupted.

🔬 Scientific Foundation

Research in child development and educational neuroscience is clear:

“When belief and values education is imposed without allowing children freedom of choice, it creates a form of traumatic pressure. This effect can later lead to anxiety, feelings of worthlessness, and crises of belonging.”
(Sources: Piaget, Kohlberg, Erikson)

🗓️ Today’s Risk

The religiously referenced discourse of Yusuf Tekin undermines not only the principle of secularism, but also the psychological safety of children.

Such language:

Creates feelings of exclusion among students who think differently,

Undermines families’ trust in the education system.

Conclusion

The duty of a state is not to impose a single truth upon children, but to teach them how to think, how to question, and how to choose their own values.

In my view, the Minister’s words are felt not merely as a political stance, but as a threat to the inner voice of our children.
