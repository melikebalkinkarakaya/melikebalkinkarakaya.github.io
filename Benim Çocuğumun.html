“No Sentence Can Bring My Child Back… And Now You’re Talking About a Reduction?”

If it were my child who had died…
If that knife had been plunged into my son’s heart in a marketplace…
And if you then turned to me and said, “The perpetrator was a minor, there will be a sentence reduction”…
I swear—my faith would collapse not only in justice, but in humanity itself.

But that child’s name was Ahmet.
And his mother was Yasemin…
A mother. A woman. A seeker of justice.
She was not standing there only for herself—she was standing in the place of everyone who still has a conscience.

And now I ask:
Does the age of the perpetrator matter more—or the age of the life that was buried?

In this country, laws written after the deaths of children have always come too late.
Sentence reductions were granted to rapists for “good conduct.”
Men who murdered women received reduced sentences for wearing a tie.
And now—are we going to respond to a mother’s tears by saying, “the offender was young”?

This is no longer a legal issue.
This is a moral test.
And those who fail this test lose not only the law—but the future.

That mother did not remain silent.
She is tired—not of crying, but of explaining.
Yet she is still standing, still in the square, still upright.
Because her son Ahmet’s blood has not yet dried.

And I am also a mother.
Yes, perhaps my child did not die…
But if this system does not change, we will all become complicit in the death of every child.

That is why I am here.
By Yasemin’s side.
Before justice.
Demanding that crime be measured not by age, but by consequence.

What does a mother want?
She wants to speak of her son’s graduation—not his funeral.
She wants to talk about her child’s dreams—not the age of his killer.

But today, Yasemin is forced to answer questions about age.
She is forced to bury her child not only in the ground, but in the contradictions of the system.

And you are still talking about a reduction?

I am a mother.
I will not remain silent.
Because one day, my child could also die.
And when that day comes, the silence of everyone who stayed quiet will kill my child once again.
