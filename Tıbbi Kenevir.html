Medical Cannabis on the Parliamentary Agenda: Not Prohibition, but Rational Regulation Is Needed
June 30, 2025 • Melike Balkın Karakaya

The recent discussions in Parliament regarding medical cannabis—brought to public attention through statements by AKP Deputy Group Chair Leyla Şahin Usta—may represent the first signal of a long-awaited step. As legal reforms in the field of healthcare are considered, the controlled use of cannabis has also entered the agenda. 👏

As a specialist clinical psychologist, and as someone who has witnessed not only theoretical frameworks but also the multifaceted human realities of the field and the true face of addiction, I am following this development closely.

Prohibition Does Not Reduce Addiction—It Pushes It Underground

Years of policies based on “prohibit, suppress, and deny” have shown that they neither reduce addiction nor protect society. On the contrary, they:

Push use into underground markets,

Lead to the spread of unregulated and potentially lethal substances,

And most importantly, stigmatize individuals struggling with addiction instead of supporting their recovery.

What Does Controlled and Medical Use Offer?

Supporting the medical use of cannabis brings several key advantages:

It provides a scientifically grounded and legally regulated alternative,

Reduces the tendency to turn toward fake or illegal substances,

CBD derivatives can be safely used in many areas such as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis (MS), chronic pain, and anxiety,

Offers harm-reduction benefits for individuals prone to addiction.

A New Paradigm Is Needed in the Fight Against Drugs

For years, we have fought the wrong battle. We punished the outcome without addressing the root of the problem.
Yet real progress begins:

Not with prohibition, but with regulation,

Not with punishment, but with rehabilitation,

Not with silencing, but with understanding.

For this reason, I advocate for bringing medical cannabis to society through controlled, permission-based, and scientifically guided frameworks. Because some substances, when used correctly, are not poison—but medicine.
