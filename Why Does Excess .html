Why Does Excess Grow as Prohibition Increases?
As a psychologist, I can state this clearly:

Morality is not the product of oppression.
Oppression does not produce morality; it produces fear.
And fear does not give rise to virtue — it gives rise to compliance.

When societies force behavior into alignment,
they do not cultivate conscience;
they merely create the appearance of order under surveillance.

Just as every suppressed impulse returns in pathological forms within the individual,
suppressed reality re-emerges within society in distorted, excessive, and uncontrolled ways.

What we are witnessing today is not merely moral decay.
It is the delayed outcome of long-accumulated repression.

In No Society Ruled by Excessive Prohibition Does Virtue Increase
On the contrary,
every suppressed impulse returns in a distorted form.

This is not an opinion.
It is a fact repeatedly demonstrated by psychology and sociology.

At the individual level, repression turns into deviation.
At the societal level, repressed reality turns into scandal.

What we are witnessing today is exactly this.

Repression ≠ Morality
Repression Produces Pathology
What Freud described as “the return of the repressed” tells us one thing clearly:

What is repressed does not disappear.
It merely changes its form.

When sexuality cannot be spoken of in society:
— abuse increases.

When morality is imposed only through slogans:
— hypocrisy spreads.

When criticism is forbidden:
— decay accelerates.

Because morality is only possible through choice.
Nothing imposed by force can be called moral.

Excessive Control Produces Excessive Collapse
In sociology, this is known as reactive extremism:

The more tightly a system suppresses something,
the more violently it erupts beyond control.

What we see on screens today reflects this dynamic precisely:
On one side, constant rhetoric about “values.”
On the other, excess, exhibitionism, and sensationalism.

This is not a coincidence.
It is the inevitable consequence of authoritarian systems.

When morality is endlessly invoked in language
while its foundations — education, justice, transparency, accountability — are dismantled,
what remains is nothing but noise.

Labeling Does Not Conceal Reality
In the face of every scandal, there is a rush to assign a label:
Blaming an ideology, a group, an identity.

This reflex does not explain reality.
It attempts to obscure it.

Because the issue is not ideology.
The issue is power, ownership, lack of oversight, and spaces without accountability.

Those who insist on speaking through labels
either do not understand the problem
or choose not to speak honestly.

Psychology Is Very Clear on This
Morality is not built through:
fear,
prohibition,
or repression — ever.
It emerges from a balance between freedom and responsibility.

When this balance collapses, what appears is not a moral society,
but uncontrolled decay.

The scandals we see today are not exceptions.
They are the natural outcome of long-standing repression.

And this outcome is not about identities.
It is about the system.

As a Psychologist — and as a Mother
Beyond being a psychologist, I also speak as a mother of four.

I know from lived experience that
children raised through pressure do not become moral —
they become obedient.

And obedience does not produce conscience.

For this reason, I chose to raise my children not through prohibitions,
but through responsibility.

I taught them that choices should be made not out of fear,
but by understanding consequences and consciously deciding.

I encouraged them to listen not to what society dictates,
but to their own conscience —
to choose what is right even in the absence of external control.

Psychology tells us this clearly:
Morality functions only when it is internalized.

And the seed of internalization is planted early in life.

If we speak today of socially responsible individuals,
we must build them not through slogans,
but by granting children freedom, responsibility, and space to think.

Otherwise, what we construct is not morality,
but an illusion of order built on fear —
one that collapses at the first shock.

Final Word
The louder a society speaks about morality,
the more silently morality disappears within it.

And the more prohibitions there are,
the more excess follows.

This is not a claim.
It is the painful but unchanging truth
of human psychology and social systems.
