      <h1>Why Does Excess Grow as Prohibition Increases?</h1>

    <div class="content">
      <p class="lead">As a psychologist, I can state this clearly: Morality is not the product of oppression. Oppression does not produce morality; it produces fear. And fear does not give rise to virtue — it gives rise to compliance.</p>

      <p>When societies force behavior into alignment, they do not cultivate conscience; they merely create the appearance of order under surveillance. Just as every suppressed impulse returns in pathological forms within the individual, suppressed reality re-emerges within society in distorted, excessive, and uncontrolled ways.</p>

      <p>What we are witnessing today is not merely moral decay. It is the delayed outcome of long-accumulated repression. In no society ruled by excessive prohibition does virtue increase. On the contrary, every suppressed impulse returns in a distorted form.</p>

      <blockquote>
        "At the societal level, repressed reality turns into scandal."
      </blockquote>

      <div class="highlight-box">
        <h2>Repression Produces Pathology</h2>
        <p>What Freud described as “the return of the repressed” tells us one thing clearly: What is repressed does not disappear. It merely changes its form.</p>
        <ul class="check-list">
          <li>When sexuality cannot be spoken of in society; <strong>abuse increases.</strong></li>
          <li>When morality is imposed only through slogans; <strong>hypocrisy spreads.</strong></li>
          <li>When criticism is forbidden; <strong>decay accelerates.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because morality is only possible through choice. Nothing imposed by force can be called moral.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Excessive Control Produces Excessive Collapse</h3>
      <p>In sociology, this is known as <strong>reactive extremism</strong>: The more tightly a system suppresses something, the more violently it erupts beyond control.</p>
      
      <p>What we see on screens today reflects this dynamic precisely: On one side, constant rhetoric about “values.” On the other, excess, exhibitionism, and sensationalism. This is not a coincidence. It is the inevitable consequence of authoritarian systems. When morality is endlessly invoked while its foundations — education, justice, transparency, accountability — are dismantled, what remains is nothing but noise.</p>

      <div class="highlight-box">
        <h2>Labeling Does Not Conceal Reality</h2>
        <p>In the face of every scandal, there is a rush to assign a label: Blaming an ideology, a group, an identity. This reflex does not explain reality. It attempts to obscure it. Because the issue is not ideology; the issue is power, ownership, lack of oversight, and spaces without accountability.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Psychology Is Very Clear</h3>
      <p>Morality is not built through fear, prohibition, or repression — ever. It emerges from a balance between <strong>freedom and responsibility</strong>. When this balance collapses, what appears is not a moral society, but uncontrolled decay. The scandals we see today are not exceptions; they are the natural outcome of long-standing repression.</p>

      <div class="highlight-box" style="border-color: var(--accent);">
        <h2>As a Psychologist — and as a Mother</h2>
        <p>Beyond being a psychologist, I also speak as a mother of four. I know from lived experience that children raised through pressure do not become moral — they become obedient. And obedience does not produce conscience.</p>
        <p>For this reason, I chose to raise my children not through prohibitions, but through responsibility. I encouraged them to listen not to what society dictates, but to their own conscience — to choose what is right even in the absence of external control. Psychology tells us this clearly: Morality functions only when it is internalized.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Final Word</h3>
      <p>The louder a society speaks about morality, the more silently morality disappears within it. And the more prohibitions there are, the more excess follows. This is not a claim. It is the painful but unchanging truth of human psychology and social systems.</p>
