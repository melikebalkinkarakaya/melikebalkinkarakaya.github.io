The Mindset That Sees Shopping Mall Queues as Prosperity

December 18, 2025
A New Form of Ignorance That Refuses to Understand the Turkish Economy

In recent years, Turkey has been experiencing one of the deepest economic fractures in its history. During a period in which purchasing power has eroded, prices have soared, and the middle class has collapsed, social behavior has also visibly changed.

Yet despite this reality, there are still people on social media who can say:

“There’s a queue at the shopping mall, so the economy must be doing well. No one is hungry.”

The shock created by this statement does not stem from the economy being bad, but from the collapse of society’s capacity to interpret the economy. Shopping mall queues are not indicators of economic prosperity; they are sociological, psychological, and behavioral outcomes of economic collapse.

Below, I explain the reasons for this in detail.

We Understand the Economy Through Data, Not Images

The logic of “There’s a queue → the economy is good” has no intersection whatsoever with scientific thinking. Because the economy is not an image—it is a set of indicators. The main indicators used to assess a country’s economic condition include:

Inflation rate and purchasing power

Loss of value against the US dollar and the euro

The minimum wage measured in dollars

Food and rent inflation

Household debt and income inequality

So What Does the Picture Look Like in Turkey?

Minimum Wage: In 2025, the net minimum wage is 22,104 TL. At the time it was announced, this amounted to approximately 630 USD, but when calculated with today’s exchange rate, it stands at around 520 USD.

Euro: By the end of 2025, the EUR/TRY exchange rate is hovering around 49–50 TL, according to market data. This represents an increase of approximately 8.5 to 9 times compared to 2019.

Food Prices: In November 2019, a basket of 20 basic food items cost 266 TL. By November 2024, the same basket had risen to 2,804 TL—a total increase of approximately 952%.

Restaurants have become inaccessible for large segments of society.
Rents have effectively erased the middle class.
Household debt is at historic levels.

With these data points clearly in front of us, interpreting shopping mall crowds as a “sign of prosperity” is like explaining an X-ray using coffee fortune-telling. This is not merely a lack of information; it is a lack of data literacy.

Conclusion: Economic Reality Is Not Undermined by Facts—Nor Saved by Hostility Toward Atatürk
