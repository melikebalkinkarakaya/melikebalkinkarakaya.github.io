Is Türkiye the "Weakest Link"?
Identifying the "Strongest Link": Who and How?
The crash of the Falcon 50 business jet carrying Libya's Chief of General Staff, Mohammed Ali al-Haddad, shortly after take-off from Ankara on the night of December 23, was presented to the public as a "technical accident." However, the ensuing debates focused less on the causes of the crash and more on how Türkiye would be positioned in the wake of this event.

For some circles, the answer was predetermined: Türkiye was the "weakest link."

This article stands precisely at this junction, posing several clear and critical questions:

Was Türkiye truly weak?

Was there a deficiency in terms of technology, security, or intelligence?

Or was the "weakest link" narrative more a product of political perception than reality?

Why Türkiye is Not Technically at Fault
First, a fundamental point must be clarified. This aircraft:

Did not belong to Türkiye,

Was not a military platform,

Was a civilian and chartered flight.

Civilian and chartered flights are connected to international civil aviation networks for maintenance, software updates, avionic systems, and operational processes. These networks are not under the absolute control of a single state.

Specifically:

The aircraft’s maintenance history,

The avionic software chain,

The electrical and flight control systems are not areas that Türkiye can control directly or unilaterally. This is not a vulnerability; it is the inherent nature of modern civil aviation. Therefore, claiming that Türkiye suffered from technical negligence, a collapse in security protocols, or an intelligence failure is based on conjecture rather than data.

Where Does the "Weakest Link" Narrative Originate?
A crucial distinction must be made here. In strategic analysis, the "weakest link" does not necessarily mean the powerless party. More often, the weakest link is:

The most visible,

The most easily blamed,

The actor through whom perceptions can be engineered.

Türkiye finds itself in exactly this position. Türkiye's progress in defense industry, intelligence capacity, and security reflexes in recent years is well known—even to its critics who acknowledge this capacity in other contexts. However, when the issue becomes politicized, these facts are deliberately sidelined, and Türkiye is automatically declared "weak" in every crisis. This is not a technical analysis; it is a political reflex.

How Can This Event Appear to be an "Accident"?
We must detach the issue from emotion and place it on a technical footing. Modern aircraft operate on digital avionic architectures rather than purely mechanical systems. Electrical systems, flight controls, sensors, and navigation software are all interconnected.

In such systems:

An electrical failure can affect multiple systems in a chain reaction,

It can present the image of a classic "technical accident" from the outside.

In these scenarios:

No explosion occurs,

No physical evidence of sabotage remains,

The event is recorded in forensic reports as a "system failure."

Consequently, "electrical failure" is one of the most convenient scenarios to make an aircraft crash appear accidental. The critical question remains: Who can produce such an outcome?

Defining the "Strongest Link"
This article is not written to name a specific country. However, it is possible to describe how the "strongest" actor behaves. The strongest link:

Does not attack directly,

Takes no responsibility,

Leaves no trace,

Produces the result while remaining outside the debate.

Such an actor:

Possesses cyber and electronic intervention capabilities,

Can interpret civilian and military systems simultaneously,

Understands vulnerabilities in maintenance and operation chains,

Produces chaos indirectly rather than directly.

This is a capacity that not every state possesses.

Why Türkiye Cannot Be the "Strongest Link" in This Equation
Because the strongest link profits from the outcome. In the aftermath of this event:

Stability in Libya has not strengthened,

Military unification has not progressed,

Uncertainty on the ground has increased.

This landscape is not in Türkiye's interest; it complicates Türkiye's position. The logic is clear: If Türkiye did not win, Türkiye is not the strongest link. Türkiye is not the target, nor the perpetrator; it is the party through which perception is being managed.

Conclusion: Türkiye is Targetted, Not Weak
Presenting Türkiye as the "weakest link" in this incident is a political narrative choice, not a technical analysis. Türkiye is not technically inadequate, nor weak in security, nor a country with low intelligence capacity.

However, it is visible and central; therefore, it becomes the first actor blamed in every crisis. The real picture shows: Being the weakest link is not being powerless. The weakest link is often the mirror used to hide the power of others.

The ultimate question remains: Who profited from this uncertainty? And more importantly: Does the technical capacity required to produce these "accident-like" results match the capacity of actors who have previously utilized similar electronic warfare, cyber intervention, and hybrid methods in the Syrian and Libyan theaters?

The answer to this question is not a country's name. But for those seeking the answer, the clues are hidden not in geographies, but in methods.
