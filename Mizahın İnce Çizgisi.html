The Fine Line of Humor: A Personal Reading of Doğan Pehlevan

One of the figures that undoubtedly shape collective memory is the cartoonist. Yet this work of memory does not progress solely through laughter; at times it advances by dividing, unsettling, and even provoking.

When I recently saw the name Doğan Pehlevan return to the public agenda through a controversial drawing, I found myself asking a simple but essential question:

“Is a line truly just criticism, or can it also be a deliberate tool of influence?”

When I look at Pehlevan’s earlier works, several recurring characteristics stand out:

His drawings often reflect ideological positioning rather than personal critique,

A caricature language that goes beyond the limits of criticism and targets the sacred or political legitimacy has emerged,

Instead of the universal language of humor, symbols that deepen cultural polarization come to the foreground.

In some of his past drawings directed at President Erdoğan, what stood out was not humor but rather agitational imagery that bordered on violating personal rights more than caricature itself. Today, using a similar method to symbolically target a religious figure appears to me not as a purely individual expression, but as a strategy of consciously steering collective emotions.

Of course, freedom of expression is a fundamental right. But this freedom gains meaning not through blindness toward what others hold sacred, but through respect grounded in shared values.

Such content creates tension rather than reflection. And humor that does not provoke thought is not humor at all—it is merely another instrument of the attention economy.

Closing note:
A caricature can make a society laugh; it can also make it think…
But it can just as easily, over time, estrange a society from itself.
There are lines that are drawn not only with a pen, but with conscious intent—and sometimes with anger.
Being able to recognize this difference is as much a responsibility as humor itself.
