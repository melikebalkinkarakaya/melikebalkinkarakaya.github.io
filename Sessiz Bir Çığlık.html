Rising Violence Among Youth: Uncontrolled Anger or a Silent Cry?

In nearly every conversation I have with young people these days, one thing stands out to me: suppressed anger.
On the streets, in schools, on social media—wherever we look, we see tension overflowing from within them. An argument that begins with a simple glance can turn into punches within seconds. Eyes filled with anger, sharp tongues, hands ready to react. It feels as though everything would resolve if someone simply tried to understand them…
Yet no one asks: “What happened to you? When did you start accumulating so much anger?”

As a psychologist, I ask this question often. Because violence is not merely a behavior. Behind it lie untold stories and unseen wounds. That is exactly what I want to address in this piece.

It is easy to label violence as a “problem.” But as a mother, a psychologist, and a social advocate, I know that it is, in fact, a result. When you dig beneath that anger, you encounter feelings of worthlessness, abandonment, neglect, and above all, a lack of love. We no longer say that young people do not know how to express their emotions—even when they do speak, no one listens. So they fall silent. And over time, that silence accumulates inside them until it eventually harms either themselves or others.

The situation is even more difficult for boys. We have raised a generation told, “Don’t cry, be strong, real men stay silent,” forcing them to bury their emotions. Then, when these boys grow up and eventually explode, we label them as “angry,” “problematic,” or “rebellious.”
Yet they are simply wounded. And they are waiting for someone to notice that wound and tend to it. What do we do instead? Sometimes we ignore them; sometimes we punish them. When in reality, what they need most is to be seen, heard, and understood.

How Did We Get Here?

No young person resorts to violence without reason. No child overflows with anger out of nowhere. They keep it inside, again and again… until one day, it spills over. But did we ever notice the glass filling up?

A child who grows up without love at home is crushed under academic pressure at school. They look at “perfect lives” on social media and feel worthless. They cannot tell anyone—because they are either judged or belittled. Then one day, that child gets angry over a glance in a park. They explode at a teacher, a classmate, or a stranger. But the anger is not truly directed at that person—it is aimed at everyone and everything they have been holding inside for years.

We tell these children, “Control your anger,” but first we must ask: How is a child who has never been able to trust anyone, surrounded by constant pressure, supposed to control themselves?

Families are more engaged with their phones than with their children. Teachers are focused on grades, and the system is exam-oriented. Emotions hold little value; scores do. Social media is an entirely different world—violent content, bullying videos, reckless acts done for followers… All of it presents violence as a “normal” and even “effective” solution.

The result?
A silent cry…
Young people who are unheard, unseen, and misunderstood—eventually reaching a breaking point.
